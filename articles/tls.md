## About This Guide

This guide covers TLS (SSL) connections to RabbitMQ with Langohr.

(including images and stylesheets). The source is available [on Github](https://github.com/clojurewerkz/langohr.docs).


## What version of Langohr does this guide cover?

This guide covers Langohr 3.6.x.


## TLS Support in RabbitMQ

RabbitMQ version 2.x and 3.x support TLS/SSL on Erlang R16B01 or later. Using the most
recent version (e.g. 17.5) is recommended.

To use TLS with RabbitMQ, you need a few things:

 * Client certificate (public key) and key (private key)
 * Server certificate and key
 * [Configure RabbitMQ to use TLS](http://www.rabbitmq.com/ssl.html)
 * If server certificate is self-signed, issuing CA's certificate


## Generating Certificates For Development

The easiest way to generate a CA, server and client keys and certificates is by using
[tls-gen](https://github.com/michaelklishin/tls-gen/). It requires `openssl` and `make` to be
available.

See [RabbitMQ TLS/SSL guide](http://www.rabbitmq.com/ssl.html) for more information
about TLS support on various platforms.


## Enabling TLS/SSL Support in RabbitMQ

TLS/SSL support is enabled using two arguments:

 * `ssl_listeners` (a list of ports TLS connections will use)
 * `ssl_options` (a proplist of options such as CA certificate file location, server key file location, and so on)

 An example:

``` erlang
[
  {rabbit, [
     {ssl_listeners, [5671]},
     {ssl_options, [{cacertfile,"/path/to/testca/cacert.pem"},
                    {certfile,"/path/to/server/cert.pem"},
                    {keyfile,"/path/to/server/key.pem"},
                    {verify,verify_peer},
                    {fail_if_no_peer_cert,false}]}
   ]}
].
```

Note that all paths must be absolute (no `~` and other shell-isms) and be readable
by the OS user RabbitMQ uses.

Learn more in the [RabbitMQ TLS/SSL guide](http://www.rabbitmq.com/ssl.html).

## Connecting to RabbitMQ with Langohr Using TLS/SSL

TBD

 * `:ssl` (a boolean) which, when set to `true`, will enable TLS on the connection and switch it to TLS port (5671)
 * `:ssl-context` (a `javax.net.ssl.SSLContext` instance) which will provide TLS private key and certificate information, and more

An example:

``` clojure
(ns langohr.examples
  (:require [langohr.core :as rmq]))

;; connect to localhost:5671 using TLS (SSLv3)
(rmq/connect {:ssl true})
```

If you configure RabbitMQ to accept TLS connections on a separate port, you need to
specify all three of `:ssl`, `:ssl-context`, and `:port`.

TBD: a convenient way to create an SSL context
